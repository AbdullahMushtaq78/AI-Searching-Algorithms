# Uniform Cost Search Algorithm to solve 8 Puzzle Problems
- Uniform Cost Search is an uninformed search algorithm and an optimal solution to find the path from the root node to the destination node with the lowest cumulative cost in a weighted search space where each node has a different traversal cost.
- 8 Puzzle is a very famous puzzle game. With the help of this algorithm, the 8-puzzle can be solved.
- Compared to other informed searching algorithms, it is much slower but can find the optimal solution in uninformed searching space.

  - There are many utility functions used, with good naming conventions followed to understand the algorithms easily by looking at the code.
  - You may not find the result/solution in seconds depending upon the puzzle's difficulty; sometimes, you must wait minutes to get the result.
