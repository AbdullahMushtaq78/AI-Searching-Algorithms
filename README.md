# AI Searching Algorithms
- There are different searching algorithms used in AI like Uninformed Searching, Informed Searching, Local Search, etc.<br/>
- This repository contains all the AI searching algorithms desgined by me to solve some AI related problems.<br/>
- Although these algorithms are not used more often but a good understanding and efficient coding cnna help you to get good knowledge about Algorithms.<br/>
- These algorithms were wastly used in many problems like solving 8 puzzle, Sudoku, Chess, etc. <br/>
- I will try to keep this repository up to date.
