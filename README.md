# AI Searching Algorithms
- There are different searching algorithms used in AI like Uninformed Searching, Informed Searching, Local Search, etc.<br/>
- This repository contains all the AI searching algorithms I designed to solve some AI-related problems.<br/>
- Although these algorithms are not used more often, a good understanding and efficient coding can help you to get good knowledge about Algorithms.<br/>
- These algorithms were widely used in many problems like solving 8 puzzles, Sudoku, Chess, etc. <br/>
- I will try to keep this repository up to date.
